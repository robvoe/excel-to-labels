# excel-to-labels
Ever needed a bunch of addresses printed on a single page for print-out, cut and glue on letters? 

This repo offers exactly this functionality â€” first you enter all desired address fields into an Excel table, and then convert them into a PDF where each page holds multiple label cells.
